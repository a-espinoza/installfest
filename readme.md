# Welcome to Installfest

You will be using [rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake) (a ruby tool for managing commands) to install the apps you will be using throughout your career.

Run the following commands, within Terminal, to start installfest.  You should be able to copy and paste each individual line into Terminal.

Read through every instruction carefully and follow them to the letter.  Computers require a significant attention to detail.

If you have ANY questions, raise your hand for assistance.


1. Make your working directory for WDI.  You will use this directory throughout the course:
  
  ```
  mkdir ~/wdi
  ```

2. Change to that directory:
  
  ```
  cd ~/wdi
  ```
  
3. Download the latest Installfest Rakefile to this directory (via `curl` command).
  
  ```
  curl --location https://git.io/vLxbY | sh
  ```

4. Run the appropriate rake command (Rake is a tool for managing scripts in Ruby):

  ```
  rake installfest:start
  ```
